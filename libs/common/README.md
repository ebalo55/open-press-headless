# @aetheria/common

üöÄ Welcome to `@aetheria/common` - the ultimate collection of common methods, utilities, and modules for Aetheria's
headless CMS! This package provides a comprehensive set of tools that cover a wide range of functionalities, from
generating random strings to validation utilities and much more.

## Features

‚ú® Here are some key features of `@aetheria/common`:

- **Random string generation**: Need a random string of a specific length? Look no further! With
  the `makeRandomString(length)` utility, you can easily generate secure random strings to suit your needs.

- **Validation utilities**: Simplify your validation process with the `validate(value, zod_schema)` method. It provides
  an intuitive way to validate your data against a Zod schema, making data validation a breeze.

- **Bootstrap utilities**: The package includes helpful bootstrap utilities to streamline the initialization process of
  your Aetheria application. These utilities provide a solid foundation for your project's setup and configuration.

- **Decorators**: Enhance your NestJS application with the included decorators. The `PublicEndpoint(is_public)`
  decorator allows you to define whether an API endpoint should be publicly accessible. The `RestUser()` decorator
  provides convenient access to the authenticated user within your controllers.

- **Hashing module**: The package includes a simple hashing module that integrates with the `HashService` provided by
  NestJS. This module handles bcrypt hashing and verification, ensuring secure password storage for your application.

- **Application models**: Find the basic application models, `User` and `Template`, along with their related services,
  NestJS modules, and controllers. These models serve as a solid starting point for building your Aetheria CMS
  application.

  Template,
  User,
  validate,
  UserDocument
} from "@aetheria/common";

// Generate a random string
const randomString = makeRandomString(10);

// Validate data against a Zod schema
const data = { /* Your data here */};
const schema = { /* Your Zod schema here */};
validate(data, schema);

// Decorators usage
@PublicEndpoint(true)
class MyController {
  getUser(@RestUser() user: UserDocument) {
    // Access the authenticated user
    // ...
  }
}

// Hashing module
const hashService = new HashService();
const hashedPassword = hashService.make("password");
const isValid = hashService.compare("password", hashedPassword);
```
